# BulletBot

This is a general-purpose Discord bot that originated from a webhook problem in the [Code Bullet and Co](https://discord.gg/3wTEZkh) server. During the prelaunch development time, the main creator [Codec](https://github.com/Jet132) decided to extend this project to replacing every bot in the server. Until now, I only replaced one entire bot but also some functions from other bots.

## Our Discord server

As this is Discord bot all contributors are on Discord. We have a server only for the bot, which you can join here:

## Getting Started

There are two types of guides in the [wiki](https://github.com/CodeBullet-Community/BulletBot/wiki). One is for actually running the bot on a server 24/7 and the other one is for setting up a development environment for your self.

- Server Setup (Running 24/7):
  - [Linux](https://github.com/CodeBullet-Community/BulletBot/wiki/Linux-Server-Setup-Guide)
  - No Windows guide (You can add one if you like)
- Development Setup:
  - [Windows](https://github.com/CodeBullet-Community/BulletBot/wiki/Windows-Dev-Setup-Guide)
  - [Linux](https://github.com/CodeBullet-Community/BulletBot/wiki/Linux-Dev-Setup-Guide)

If you need help you can ask on the Discord server.
