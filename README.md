This is a general-purpose Discord bot that originated from a webhook problem in the [Code Bullet and Co](https://discord.gg/3wTEZkh) server. During the prelaunch development time, the main creator [Codec](https://github.com/Jet132) decided to extend this project to replacing every bot in the server. Until now, I only replaced one entire bot but also some functions from other bots.

## Our Discord server

As this is Discord bot all contributors are on Discord. We have a server for the bot, which you can join here:

## Getting Started

There are two types of guides for setting BulletBot up. One is for running the bot from the most recent release (production) and the other one is for setting up a development environment for your self.

- Production Setup:

  - No Windows guide (You can add one if you like)
- Development Setup:
  - [Windows](https://bulletbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup-Guides/Development/Linux-Dev-Setup-Guide/)
  - [Linux](https://bulletbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Setup-Guides/Development/Windows-Dev-Setup-Guide/)

If you need help you can ask on the Discord server.
