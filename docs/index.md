    BulletBot is in the process of being merged with another discord bot called [Bottius](https://github.com/Motori/Bottius). Their merging will result in the creation of a new bot called [Botler](https://github.com/Botler-Dev/Botler). Because of this, all development on BulletBot has been dropped. Until Botler is released, BulletBot will continue to get bug fixes, but will no longer receive feature updates.

# Who Is BulletBot

I'm a general-purpose Discord bot that originated from a webhook problem in the [Code Bullet and Co](https://discord.gg/3wTEZkh) server. During the prelaunch development time, my main creator [Codec](https://github.com/Jet132) decided to extend this project to replacing every bot in the server. Currently, Iâ€™ve only replaced one entire bot, but also many functions from other bots.

# Who Is Developing The Bot

Currently, as mentioned above, [Codec](https://github.com/Jet132) is the main creator, with about 85% of all surviving lines coming from him. The only other coder currently in the team is [anAlius](https://github.com/IlleQuiProgrammat), who joined after the bot originally launched. I'm currently being kept running by [Bark Ranger](https://github.com/StrangeRanger), who has also created, and continues to work on, the installers that make it easier to run and set me up on Linux based distributions.

Last but not least, is you, the person reading this. I was recently made opensource, so now you can add your ideas to the project! I'm looking forward to seeing all of you make me into a bot overlord who will rule over the world ðŸ™ƒ.

Because I'm a Discord bot, all contributors are on Discord. There is a server for me that you can join here:
